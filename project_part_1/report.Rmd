Report
Write a report, of approximately 4 pages (excluding Supplementary data), in the
format of a technical report: Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion and
Supplementary material.

The Intro should be short, briefly summarising the project.

The Methods section of your report should include a description of the
preparation of the data, the statistical models used in your analysis and of the
statistical tests conducted. Provide details and explain every analysis. For
example, any limitations in the data that affect your ability to perform
standard QC should be described.

Results should only present important results of your analysis. This is usually
written in a “stating” fashion, i.e. no judgements, just facts (we found, we
observed, etc). Your results can be illustrated by important figures (usually 2-3,
e.g. a Manhattan plot of your analysis). Non-important figures (e.g. a
figure on missingness percentage) will go into Supplementary material.

Supplementary material: Include the relevant part of your code (please do NOT
include log files). It should include your plink and R commands so they can be
checked and reproduced if needed. Combine everything into a single document.
This is the only part of your report that should include code. Extra figures
should be included in this part.

Please combine everything into a single pdf and submit through Blackboard

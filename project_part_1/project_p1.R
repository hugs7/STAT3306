# Analysis
# Analyse your data set and write a detailed report about all
# your analyses. This should include:
# • SNP QC


# • Sample QC (excluding checking ancestry – you can assume this
#   has been done already)


# • Genome-wide association analysis of the three traits


# • Describe the most associated region of the quantitative trait


# • A comparison of the results for these different traits sets
#   demonstrating an understanding of how the results from the
#   three traits relate to each other.
